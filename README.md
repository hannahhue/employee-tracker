# Employee Tracker

## Description

Employee Tracker is a great way for managers and owners to keep track of employees! You can manage salary, pay! Its easy to update roles and gather information about your employees quickly. My motivstion was to see if I could utilize SQL in a productive and inventive way. I learned about using multiple keys and got to play around with selecting multiple objects at once. If youre struggling to organize your employees or coworkers this could be a great application for you!
